International RPKs recovered to 62.2% of 2019 traffic and grew 152.7% YoY from 2021 levels. • Industry-wide RPKs increased by 39.7% YoY in December and reached 76.9% of pre-pandemic levels for the same month. Compared to December 2021, domestic passenger traffic grew 2.6% while international traffic grew 80.2%. • Monitored domestic markets continued to show resilience and steady traffic levels. International passenger traffic within and between the Asia Pacific region and the rest of the world also continued to show positive trends.\\n\\nTotal domestic ticket sales have seen an uptick over the month of January 2023. This positive development is mainly attributable to China PR reopening. On the other hand, international ticket sales have caught up to domestic in terms of recovery to 2019 sales volumes.

Passenger load factors for 2022 were only 3.9 percentage points (ppts) below the load factors achieved before the pandemic in 2019. Similar observations can also be made at the regional level.\\n\\nindustry-wide passenger\\n\\nGlobally, domestic operations ramped up quicker than international as domestic travel policies offered more certainty to passengers. Despite the setbacks caused by lingering travel restrictions, international traffic\\n\\ntook off significantly these restrictions were taken down. As a result, international RPKs surged from 26.8% of 2019 levels in 2021 to 62.2% in 2022.\\n\\nin 2022 wherever\\n\\nAirlines faced uneven outcomes in 2022. North American carriers led the industry by achieving close- to pre-pandemic passenger traffic levels with total RPKs 11.3% under 2019 volumes, followed by Latin American and European carriers at 14.2% and 22.2%, respectively, below 2019 levels.\\n\\nOver the past year, re-openings in many economies of the Asia Pacific region allowed for passengers and airlines to return to the skies, greatly accelerating traffic growth in both domestic and international markets. While performed RPKs in 2022 were 54.4% under the levels of 2019 for this region’s airlines, the recent developments related to the reopening of international travel in China PR give a positive outlook for the months to come.\\n\\nAir passenger market overview - December 2022World share1RPKASKPLF (%-pt)2PLF (level)3RPKASKPLF (%-pt)2PLF (level)3TOTAL MARKET100.0%-23.1%-22.1%-1.1%81.1%39.7%23.0%9.7%81.1% International58.0%-24.9%-25.2%0.3%82.0%80.2%47.8%14.7%82.0% Domestic42.0%-20.1%-16.8%-3.3%79.6%2.6%-2.5%3.9%79.6%1% of industry RPKs in 20222Change in load factor vs same month in 20193Load factor levelDecember 2022 (% ch vs the same month in 2019)December 2022 (% year-on-year)\\n\\nAir Passenger Monthly Analysis – December 2022\\n\\nThe year ends on a strong note for the global industry\\n\\nIn December, industry-wide RPKs grew by 39.7% YoY and stood at 76.9% of December 2019 levels (Chart 1), a 2ppts increase from the month prior.
